=> JRE

	- JRE is an acronym for Java Runtime Environment.
	- It is also written as Java RTE.
	- The Java Runtime Environment is a set of software tools which are used for developing Java applications. 
	- It is used to provide the runtime environment. It is the implementation of JVM. 
	- It physically exists. 
	- It contains a set of libraries + other files that JVM uses at runtime.

=> JDK

	- JDK is an acronym for Java Development Kit. The Java Development Kit (JDK) is a software development environment which is used to develop Java applications and applets.
	- It physically exists. It contains JRE + development tools.
	- JDK is an implementation of any one of the below given Java Platforms released by Oracle Corporation:

			1. Standard Edition Java Platform
			2. Enterprise Edition Java Platform
			3. Micro Edition Java Platform 
			
	- The JDK contains a private Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and a few other resources such as 
			
			1. an interpreter/loader (java), 
			2. a compiler (javac),
			3. an archiver (jar), 
			4. a documentation generator (Javadoc), etc. 
			
			to complete the development of a Java Application.

=> JVM

	- JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is an abstract machine. 
	- It is called a virtual machine because it doesn't physically exist.
	-  It is a specification that provides a runtime environment in which Java bytecode can be executed.
	
	- The JVM performs the following main tasks:

		Loads code
		Verifies code
		Executes code
		Provides runtime environment
