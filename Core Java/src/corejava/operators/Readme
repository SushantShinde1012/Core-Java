
Operators:-

	- Operator in Java is a symbol which is used to perform operations. 
	- Types
	
		Unary Operator,
		Arithmetic Operator,
		Shift Operator,
		Relational Operator,
		Bitwise Operator,
		Logical Operator,
		Ternary Operator and
		Assignment Operator.
		
	1. Unary Operator
	
		The Java unary operators require only one operand. Unary operators are used to perform various operations i.e.:

			incrementing/decrementing a value by one
			negating an expression
			inverting the value of a boolean
			
	2. Arithmetic Operator
	
		Java arithmatic operators are used to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 
		They act as basic mathematical operations.
		
	3. Shift Opeartor
	
		-> The Java left shift operator << is used to shift all of the bits in a value to the left side of a specified number of times.
		
		-> The Java right shift operator >> is used to move left operands value to right by the number of bits specified by the right operand.
		
	4. Logical Opeartors
	
		-->AND (&&)
		
			-The logical && operator doesn't check second condition if first condition is false. 
			- It checks second condition only if first one is true.
			- The bitwise & operator always checks both conditions whether first condition is true or false.
			
		--> OR (||)
		
			- The logical || operator doesn't check second condition if first condition is true. 
			- It checks second condition only if first one is false.
			- The bitwise | operator always checks both conditions whether first condition is true or false.
		--> NOT (!)
			
	5. Ternary Operator
	
		- Java Ternary operator is used as one liner replacement for if-then-else statement and used a lot in Java programming. 
		- it is the only conditional operator which takes three operands.
		
	6. Assignment Operators
	
		-It is used to assign the value on its right to the operand on its left.
